            Checking Account App
            Create a checking account component consisting of an h1 element that displays your current account balance,
            and 2 input fields with buttons, one for deposits (adding money to the account) and one for withdrawals (subtracting money from the account). (This can also be done without buttons; I’ll leave it up to you how exactly you want to implement this.)
            Use the componentDidMount() life cycle method 
                (i) to retrieve the balance from localStorage once the App component is mounted, 
                and (ii) to store the balance in localStorage when the window’s “beforeunload” event fires.
        */
        /* 
            BONUS:
            1. Add an input field called "Dispo Amount" where the user can set a max negative for his/her account balance.
            This value should be stored in the state and referenced on withdrawals.
            When withdrawing an amount that would drag the balance lower than the allowed dispo amount, the transaction should be prohibited.
            
            2. Create a transaction history in the state which stores every transaction made on the account (deposit/withdraw) with a timestamp and the amount.
            The transactions should be stored as objects like this
            {
                type: 'withdrawal',
                amount: 100,
                timestamp: new Date()
            }
            Show this history in a table or list below
